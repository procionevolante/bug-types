\section*{Bug Types\footnote{Inspired from \texttt{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heisenbug}}}

\entry{Bohrbug}{bohr-bug}
{
    \emph{A "good, solid bug".} \\
    Like the deterministic Bohr atom model, it does not change its
    behavior and is relatively easily detected.
}

\entry{Heisenbug}{hei-sen-bug}
{
    A software bug that seems to disappear or alter its behavior when one
    attempts to study it. \\
    The term is a pun on the name of Werner Heisenberg, the physicist who
    first asserted the observer effect of quantum mechanics, which states
    that the act of observing a system inevitably alters its state.
}

\entry{Higgs-bugson}{higgs-bug-son}
{
    \emph{Named after the Higgs boson particle.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A bug that is predicted to exist based upon other observed
            conditions (most commonly, vaguely related log entries and
            anecdotal user reports) but is difficult, if not impossible, to
            artificially reproduce in a development or test environment.
        \item A bug that is obvious in the code (mathematically proven),
            but which cannot be seen in execution (yet difficult or
            impossible to actually find in existence).
    \end{itemize}
}

\entry{Hindenbug}{hin-den-bug}
{
    \emph{Named after the Hindenburg disaster.} \\
    It's a bug with catastrophic behavior.
}

\entry{Mandelbug}{man-del-bug}
{
    \emph{Named after Benoît Mandelbrot's fractal.}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A bug whose causes are so complex it defies repair, or makes
            its behavior appear chaotic or even non-deterministic.
        \item A bug that exhibits fractal behavior (that is,
            self-similarity) by revealing more bugs (the deeper a developer
            goes into the code to fix it the more bugs they find).
    \end{itemize}
}

\entry{Schrödinbug}{schrö-din-bug}
{
    \emph{Named after Erwin Schrödinger and his thought experiment.} \\
    A bug that manifests itself in running software after a programmer
    notices that the code should never have worked in the first place.
}
